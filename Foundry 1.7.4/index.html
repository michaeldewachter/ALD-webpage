This is easier said than done when dealing with a commodity product. This is why product differentiation is depending on the communication between ALD and its drivers.

By doing this ALD will be provided with valuable data regarding their cars and its drivers collected during each service (3 times per year).

This will be possible through the communication platform supported by the application. To gain access to this platform, the driver will first have to sign up. This will make it easy to track and monitor each of the driver's behavior and interests.
